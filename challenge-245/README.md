We have discovered a new species of aliens! They look like this and are trying to communicate with us using the /r/ggggg subreddit! As you might have been able to tell, though, it is awfully hard to understand what they're saying since their super-advanced alphabet only makes use of two letters: "g" and "G". Fortunately, their numbers, spacing and punctuation are the same.
We are going to write a program to translate to and from our alphabet to theirs, so we can be enlightened by their intelligence.
Feel free to code either the encoding program, the decoding program, or both.
